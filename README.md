## Topic(s) Covered
We’ve looked over Netflix Top Shows and Movies & Netflix's Daily Top 10 and formulated questions based on that. We’re analyzing popularity trends and how they’ve changed over time. This will help us determine what makes a TV series or movie successful



## Product Overview
We will be building an ELT data pipeline based on the [Netflix Top Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/netflix-top-rated-movies-and-tv-shows-2020-2022) and [Movies & Netflix's Daily Top 10 List](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasertk/netflix-daily-top-10-in-us). To create the data pipeline, we will be targeting certain questions to help us find what type of characteristics lead to successful movies and TV Shows. To construct this and build a DAG, we will be using sources from Kaggle and building tools such as Snowflake, dbt, Fivetran, SQL, and Python.
